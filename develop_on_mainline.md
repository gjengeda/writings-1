How to develop on mainline
==========================

As we are working on software projects we often need to develop
multiple features concurrently, and if we are delivering these features
continuously they should be made available for our users as soon as they
have matured. Unfortunately for us, features are seldom finished at the
same time. Therefore, we need mechanisms for controlling when a given
feature is made available.
