# Continuous Delivery: Avoiding suboptimization

A lot of enterprises have instituted DevOps transformations and/or large-scale agile transformations during the last years (e.g. [ING](http://www.mckinsey.com/industries/financial-services/our-insights/ings-agile-transformation)).

- Lack of strategic management
    - No connection to the IT strategy
    - Too much bottom-up and to little top-down
    - Having a clear vision

"To deliver on the entrepreneurial vision, a deliberate strategy should be agreed upon by senior executives. It should be crafted with involvement throughout the organization, from a rigorous evaluation of the firmâ€™s current strengths and weaknesses, internal resources and capabilities, and external opportunities and threats."
