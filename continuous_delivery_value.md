Why should the business guys care about Continuous Delivery?
============================================================

Continuous Delivery (CD) does not neccessarily mean that we push new features
into production often, it means that we are able to push new features
into production as soon as they are ready. If you push out new features
every day, but those features were "finished" two months ago, you're not
doing CD.

This also applies to the other stages of an ideas lifecycle: we want to
decrease the time an idea spends as work-in-progress. In the lean world 
this is known as _cycle time_. Having a low cycle time gives us many of the
benefits explained below.
