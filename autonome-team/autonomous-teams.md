Autonomous teams – Organizing for Speed and Agility
===================================================

Lead time is the time it takes you to complete a process, for instance from conceiving an idea to actually having something implemented in production. Shortening this lead time makes everything better. If you think it doesn't apply to you you're probably ripe for being naturally selected in really really bad way.

For innovation to work optimally learning has be as time and cost efficient as possible. Increase lead time and you'll reduce your learning rate. Increase deployment costs and you'll reduce the number of hypotheses you can run for the same amount of money, thereby reducing the number of features you can try out before running out of money or having your steering committee loose their patience and kicking your ass out on the street.

This blogposts highlights some common organizational pitfalls that negatively impacts your ability to deliver.

Handovers – slow and steady wins the race
-----------------------------------------

... in fairy tales.

Anyone who has ever worked on anything with more people than only themselves have experienced that the one thing that impacts lead time more than anything else is handovers. Some handovers we can't easily be without if we need people to specialize as developers, designers, and so on. Some handovers though, we can avoid by designing our organization in a smart instead of a stupid way.

Different teams have different goals and backlogs–it's why we split our organizations in multiple teams in the first place, to be able to work concurrently with more than one thing. And because different teams have different goals and backlogs they'll also have different priorities. The shitty conclusion is that if we design our organization so that every feature requires work done on more than one team we're gonna have a bad time! That includes "thinking work" by business people and other people who like to "analyze".

Teams organized around business outcomes.

As long as you divide your people into teams you're going to have silos and suboptimization. Just by existing, teams act as barriers to communication, so what we need to do is to organize our teams in a way that causes suboptimization to be as optimal as possible. The 


Loosly coupled teams
- Depends on others to implement every new feature
- Depends on others for infrastructural changes
