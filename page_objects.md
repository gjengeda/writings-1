Page Objects in JavaScript
==========================

Some JavaScript views are complex; they have a lot of markup and they have a lot of logic, and therefore, they are often hard to test. If these views are very susceptible to change they will likely burden you with a lot of exstra work keeping the tests running green. Failures may be caused by changes to the markup, some selector, or maybe some ajax response. Other complicating factors might be the views' frequency of use and how hard they are to mock.

This blog post will deal with testing complex views in a maintainable way through the use of _Page Objects_ (though the examples will be simple for educational purposes).

The lowest hanging fruit is to start wrapping you selectors behind some abstractions.

Hiding flow between views

Hiding backend communication
