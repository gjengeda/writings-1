Page Objects in JavaScript
==========================

Some JavaScript views are complex; they have a lot of markup and they have a lot of logic, and therefore, they are often hard to test. If these views are very susceptible to change they will likely burden you with a lot of exstra work keeping the tests running green. Failures may be caused by changes to the markup, some selector, or maybe some ajax response.
